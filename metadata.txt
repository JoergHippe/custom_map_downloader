description=Extent-based export of georeferenced rasters (GeoTIFF/PNG/JPEG) with GSD control and optional VRT tiling
version=0.3.0
author=Abhinav Jayswal

about=Custom Map Downloader exports visible QGIS layers extent-based: pick a layer, choose an output CRS, set ground sampling distance (map units per pixel) and export a georeferenced raster. Pixel width/height are derived from extent and GSD; world files are always written. Optional VRT mode writes tiled GeoTIFFs plus a portable VRT instead of a merged raster. Designed for XYZ/WMTS/WMS, raster and vector layers with progress feedback and automatic layer loading.
